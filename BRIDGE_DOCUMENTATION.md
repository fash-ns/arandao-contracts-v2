# AranDAO Bridge System - Complete Documentation
*A Simple Guide to Understanding the Bridge System*

## üåâ What is This Bridge System?

Think of this bridge system like a **currency exchange service** that helps people move their digital assets from an old system to a new, improved system. Just like when a country changes its currency and provides an exchange service at banks, this bridge helps AranDAO users exchange their old digital tokens and NFTs for new ones.

## üéØ Main Purpose

The AranDAO Bridge was created to help users **migrate** (move) their digital assets from:
- **Old System** ‚Üí **New System**

This includes:
- ü™ô **Tokens** (UVM and DNM coins)
- üñºÔ∏è **NFTs** (Digital collectibles representing virtual land)
- üìà **Staking Investments** (Locked investments that earn rewards)

## üèóÔ∏è System Components

### 1. **The Bridge Contract (AranDAOBridge)**
This is the main "building" where all exchanges happen. Think of it as the bank branch where customers come to exchange their old currency.

### 2. **The Library (BridgeLib)**
This contains all the "tools and procedures" that the bridge uses to operate safely and efficiently. Like the instruction manual that bank employees follow.

## üìã What Types of Assets Can Be Exchanged?

### **Digital Coins/Tokens:**
1. **UVM** - A utility token (like points in a rewards program)
2. **DNM** - The main currency token
3. **Arusense NFTs** - Digital certificates representing virtual land ownership
4. **Wrapper Tokens** - Special containers that hold Arusense NFTs
5. **Staking Investments** - Long-term locked investments that earn rewards

## üîÑ How the Bridge Works (Step by Step)

### **Phase 1: Taking Snapshots (Record Keeping)**
Before the bridge opens, the system administrators take a "photograph" of everyone's holdings:

1. **Snapshot DNM Balances**: Records how much DNM each person owns
2. **Snapshot UVM Balances**: Records how much UVM each person owns  
3. **Snapshot NFT Collections**: Records which digital land pieces each person owns
4. **Snapshot Staking Records**: Records everyone's investment details

*Why snapshots?* This ensures only people who owned assets before the bridge opened can exchange them, preventing fraud.

### **Phase 2: Exchange Services (30-Day Window)**
Once the bridge opens, users have **30 days** to exchange their assets:

#### **ü™ô Token Exchanges:**

**UVM Exchange:**
- User brings their old UVM tokens
- Bridge takes the old UVM tokens
- Bridge gives back new DNM tokens (at a rate of 1000 UVM = 1 DNM)
- *Example: If you have 5000 old UVM, you get 5 new DNM*

**DNM Exchange:**
- User brings their old DNM tokens
- Bridge takes the old DNM tokens  
- Bridge gives back the same amount in new DNM tokens
- *Example: 100 old DNM = 100 new DNM*

#### **üñºÔ∏è NFT Exchanges:**

**Arusense Land NFT Exchange:**
- User brings their digital land certificate
- System checks the land's original purchase price
- Bridge takes the old land NFT
- Bridge calculates and gives new DNM based on the land's value
- *The more valuable the land, the more new DNM you receive*

**Wrapper Token Exchange:**
- These are like "gift boxes" containing Arusense land
- User brings their wrapper token
- System "unwraps" it to find the land inside
- Same process as Arusense exchange based on the land's value

#### **üìà Staking Investment Exchanges:**

**Staking Principle (Main Investment):**
- For completed staking investments (after 30+ days from bridge opening)
- User can withdraw their original investment (UVM + DNM + Land)
- Bridge converts everything to new DNM tokens based on current values
- This is like cashing out a certificate of deposit

**Staking Yield (Earned Rewards):**
- For the profits earned from staking investments
- Can be withdrawn after 300+ days from investment completion
- User specifies how much reward they want to withdraw
- Bridge converts UVM rewards to new DNM (1000 UVM = 1 DNM)

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Mechanisms

### **Time Limits:**
- **30-day deadline**: Users must exchange basic tokens/NFTs within 30 days
- **Extended deadlines for staking**: Staking withdrawals have longer, specific timeframes
- **No extensions**: Once deadlines pass, exchanges are no longer possible

### **Ownership Verification:**
- **Snapshot checking**: Only assets owned before the snapshot can be exchanged
- **Current ownership**: Users must still own the assets when they try to exchange
- **No double-spending**: Each asset can only be exchanged once

### **Amount Limits:**
- **Minimum amounts**: Users can only exchange what they actually own
- **Maximum amounts**: Users cannot exchange more than their snapshot shows
- **Balance verification**: System checks current balances before any exchange

### **Administrator Controls:**
- **Only the owner** can take snapshots and withdraw collected assets
- **Emergency withdrawals**: Administrators can retrieve assets if needed
- **No user access to admin functions**: Regular users cannot access admin controls

## üí∞ Exchange Rates and Calculations

### **Simple Exchanges:**
- **UVM to DNM**: 1000 UVM = 1 DNM
- **Old DNM to New DNM**: 1:1 (same amount)

### **NFT Value Calculations:**
For land NFTs, the system uses the original purchase price:
- **Base Value (BV)**: Original price in one currency
- **Sell Value (SV)**: Original price in another currency  
- **Formula**: (BV + SV √ó 1,000,000,000,000) √∑ 1000 = New DNM amount

*This ensures fair compensation based on what users originally paid for their land*

## ‚è∞ Important Deadlines

### **General Bridge Operations:**
- **30 days from bridge launch**: Deadline for UVM, DNM, and NFT exchanges

### **Staking Withdrawals:**
- **Principle withdrawal**: Available 30+ days after the later of:
  - Original staking period completion, OR
  - Bridge launch date
- **Yield withdrawal**: Available 30+ days after the later of:
  - 300 days after staking completion, OR  
  - 30 days after bridge launch

## üîß Administrator Functions

### **Setup Functions (One-time):**
1. **Take Snapshots**: Record everyone's asset holdings
2. **Configure Addresses**: Set up connections to old and new token systems

### **Withdrawal Functions (After bridge operation):**
1. **Withdraw Collected Assets**: Remove old tokens/NFTs that users exchanged
2. **Withdraw Remaining New Tokens**: Remove any leftover new DNM tokens

### **Emergency Functions:**
- Ability to withdraw any assets if problems occur

## üö® What Happens After the Deadline?

- **Exchanges stop**: No more exchanges are possible
- **Assets remain**: Old assets stay in user wallets but become worthless in the new system
- **Admin cleanup**: Administrators can withdraw collected assets
- **New system continues**: Only new DNM tokens work in the updated system

## üéØ Real-World Example

**Sarah's Journey:**

1. **Before Bridge**: Sarah owns:
   - 10,000 old UVM tokens
   - 500 old DNM tokens  
   - 1 Arusense land NFT (worth 2000 BV + 500 SV)

2. **Snapshot Day**: System records Sarah's holdings

3. **Bridge Opens**: Sarah has 30 days to exchange

4. **Sarah's Exchanges**:
   - Exchanges 10,000 UVM ‚Üí Gets 10 new DNM
   - Exchanges 500 old DNM ‚Üí Gets 500 new DNM
   - Exchanges land NFT ‚Üí Gets 2.5 new DNM (calculated from land value)
   - **Total**: 512.5 new DNM tokens

5. **After 30 Days**: Bridge closes, Sarah can only use new DNM in the updated system

- **Accepts**: Old UVM tokens, old DNM tokens, land NFTs, and staking investments
- **Provides**: New DNM tokens at fair exchange rates
- **Ensures**: Only legitimate asset owners can make exchanges
- **Operates**: Within strict time limits for security and efficiency
- **Protects**: Against fraud through multiple validation systems

The system successfully balances **user convenience** with **security requirements**, ensuring a smooth transition from the old system to the new one while protecting everyone involved.
